Start with mobile first -- Bootstrap is apparently good at handling different size devices

Different groups - D&D / LAN / WAN / Game Night / Star Wars

What would the home page be? Recap of whatever happened previously at one of these events?

Each page would need its own way to interact with users, which means the site would have to have some way to sign up.

Tabs at top with one content space in the middle, split between interaction and display.

Check out othet site designs that may offer a similar service.

D&D ---> Mostly a discussion of when people can meet up and a summary of what has happened so far.
	 Would also be helpful to have a general discussion part to talk about future adventures or characters.

LAN ---> Need a section saying what date you are available to come to an event. Calendar would be nice, checkmark days.
	 Also need a portion to elect games that we want to play and discuss each one?
	 Then when things are decided publish what was decided and some tasks for people to do before they arrive.
	    -> Also send notifications to people who haven't responded

WAN ---> A day where we play games online and to kind of decide which we are interested in now and who else might want to join.
	 Maybe a different game each week? Try out different stuff and later on put it on a stream.

Game Night --> This one is mostly the same schedule each week. Would just to facilitate where it would be located
	       and also what games we might want to try out that time and talk about other games we might have heard
               about and whether someone wants to get it. Andy's input would be good.

Star Wars ---> Date fluctuates moreso than the D&D event so it would use the Calendar portion of the LAN portion and
	       maybe a general discussion portion to talk about other things related to the game. Interactve Calendar,
	       click something for Yes you can make it, click other for no you can't. Add totals to see what day works
               best.
