				<h2>Clear off a sitting space and grab yourself a drink. It may be a while before we can begin.</h2>
				<p>This game night is usually hosted at Christian's place in Fincastle. Since early 2016 the group has played D&amp;D when everyone arrives,
				and other card/board games before and after if there is time. There's always a handful of options every night depending on what is brought and how many people we need to accomodate.</p>
				<p>Some favorites include Sherriff of Nottingham, Magic the Gathering: Commander, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Monopoly, Mysterium,
				 Settlers of Cattan, Boss Monster, 7 Wonders, Epic Spell Wars, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Codenames, Jenga and Fight Club&trade; larp.</p>

				<h3>3/12 - Dungeons &amp; Dickjokes</h3>
				<p>I believe it has been about a year of D&amp;D at this point. We have lost a group member and gained two since the start.
				The party has just left the sea of grass and journeyed to Tormaud(?) in search of a nerd to translate our brillnicky(?) book that was
				taken from, who we think to be, the lead air cultist in service to Al-Azandar. Our contact in the capital has agreed to translate
				the book but it is encoded with a cipher and may take up to a week to translate in full. Xuk finds that he needs to brush up on his interviewing skills.
				The group returns to The Lazy Bowman with news that our invitations to the King's soiree was not given by anyone at the court.
				We realize that the tracking ring may be the culprit and make plans to protect ourselves during the night. With "nothing happening"
				during the night, we awake later that morning.</p>
				
				<h3>4/16 - DnD &amp; Commander</h3>
				<p>The party had acquired a new cooler because the gaseous foe in the ice box had not yet been vanquished. 
				Along the barge trip to the keep south of Bulette we were waylaid by lizardmen but hastily dispatched them.
				Zoeth finally put it back in the box and we got a free stay in an unused watch tower when we arrived.
				Now the captain of the keep has asked us to look into why the lizardmen are up so far north in the first place.
				One way or another these lizard bastards will vacate the tunnels. Show up 4/30 to help decide their fate!</p>
