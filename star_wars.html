				<hr>
				<p>the Star Wars roleplaying session which occurs every week usually on a tuesday or wednesday night.</p>
				<p>some Star Wars lore conversation stolen from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLore/">reddit</a> to fill out the space.</p>
				<p class="question">Why did the Jedi forbid fighting in the mandalorian wars but not the separatist wars? 
				For that matter, why didn't they fight in mandalorian wars? weren't they like most wars? Some opposing forces to the republic backed by the sith?</p>
				<p>because four thousand odd years had passed. the order had changed. it could also be argued that the diminishing connection to the force clouded their judgement. 
				Either way, the order was flawed at the time i'd the clone wars. Whether they should have entered the mandalorian wars could also be up for debate. </p>
				<p class="question">So basically the answer is they did because that was their mindset? What do you mean by diminishing connection to the force?</p>
				<p>The council (Yoda and Windu i think) talk about how the dark side had clouded their vision. And it has been hinted at that their connection had been diminished. 
				i can't think whether it was episode one or two but the discussion is there.</p>
