					Hello welcome to the site! This is an ongoing project to help organize all the different gaming functions that happen to be going on in my life. 
					Also it serves as a demo and learning experience in order to get used to coding again after a long hiatus.</p>

					The content portion here will be replaced when you select which activity you're interested in from the top menu.
					Each page will have its own interaction area on the right side for voting and the such.
					Different events will be able to be created in order to solidify when something is happening and to group activities that occur on that date to the event.</p>
				<p>
					DnD - The Dungeons & Dragons session that happens almost every Thursday @ 8-8:30pm</p>
				<p>
					Star Wars - The Star Wars roleplaying session which occurs every other week usually on a Tuesday or Wednesday night.</p>
				<p>
					Table Top - A night of various board or card games hosted every other Wednesday from 7:30pm until whenever.</p>
				<p>
					WAN - An upcoming weekly or bi-weekly event to organize a video game session online. Games may change every week.</p>
				<p>
					LAN - Happens every few months or so usually on a weekend. Bring your rig over and let's play games until our eyes hurt!</p>
